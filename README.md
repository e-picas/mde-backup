**PHP Extended Markdown** is a PHP class to transform Markdown text files or strings in HTML. This new version of a Markdown parser tries to purpose a complete set of Markdown syntax tags and rules and to be PHP5 compliant.


## What is Markdown?

Created by [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) in 2004, **Markdown** is, as he says:

    a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you 
    to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it 
    to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

As I would say, **Markdown** is a set of writing rules to build some human readable text contents, such as `.txt` common files, which can be parsed to build some HTML valid content, structurally and typographically.

This syntax has become one of the most common standards of rich-text contents, used for example by [GitHub](http://github.com) as one of the proposed syntaxes for informational files.


## A short history of Markdown

The first idea was from [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/), coded in *Perl* script.

An extended implementation, known as **Markdown Extra**, has been written by [Michel Fortin](http://michelf.com/), coded in *PHP* script.

Another extended implementation, known as **Multi Markdown**, has been written by [Fletcher T. Penney](http://fletcherpenney.net/), coded in *Perl* script.


## So why a new version of Markdown?

-   This version, known as **PHP Extended Markdown**, tries to collect the different rules and tags used by the three versions listed above.
-   It is a PHP script that can be used in any PHP project.
-   It can be used in command line interface, with a full set of options.
-   It can be configured for specific needs.
