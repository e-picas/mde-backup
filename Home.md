## Why a new *Markdown* parser ?

That's true, many parsers already exist for Markdown syntax, in different coding languages and for different usages ... So why create a new one ? Just for fun ?

No. As I often use the [Fletcher Penney](http://fletcherpenney.net/)'s [**Multi Markdown**](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) parser, a *Perl* version working in command line and with a full set of specific features (*such as glossary and bibliography notes, attributes in images, advanced HTML tables construction ...*), I was sad to not be able to use it naturally in my PHP applications.

So I took *the bull by the horn* (*french expression*) and decided to modify the original great PHP version of Markdown, written by [Michel Fortin](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/), to add all features of the Multi version.

Please see the [Working Method](https://github.com/PieroWbmstr/Full_PHP_Markdown/wiki/Working-Method) page to learn about this project structure and read the [Working Journal](https://github.com/PieroWbmstr/Full_PHP_Markdown/wiki/Working-Journal) to follow this work.

## Note about this wiki

As I am french (*désolé*), I try to write documentation pages in understandable english ... but I probably make a huge language errors. Please be kind enough to correct them or inform me about it ... And, finally, do not held against.

Thank you in advance.
