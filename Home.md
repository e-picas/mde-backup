-   the [Working Method](https://github.com/PieroWbmstr/Full_PHP_Markdown/wiki/Working-Method) explains the way I try to work on this project
-   the [Working Journal](https://github.com/PieroWbmstr/Full_PHP_Markdown/wiki/Working-Journal) is a sort of diary of the wip
-   the [Markdown Syntax cheat sheet](https://github.com/PieroWbmstr/Full_PHP_Markdown/wiki/Markdown-Syntax-Cheat-Sheet) is a complete and condensed syntax rules to use

## Why a new *Markdown* parser ?

That's true, many parsers already exist for Markdown syntax, in different coding languages and for different usages ... So why create a new one ? Just for fun ?

No. As I often use the [Fletcher Penney](http://fletcherpenney.net/)'s [**Multi Markdown**](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/) parser, a *Perl* version working in command line and with a full set of specific features (*such as glossary and bibliography notes, attributes in images, advanced HTML tables construction ...*), I was sad to not be able to use it naturally in my PHP applications.

So I took *the bull by the horn* (*french expression*) and decided to modify the extended original [Michel Fortin](http://michelf.com/)'s PHP version, [**Markdown Extra**](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/), to add all features of the Multi version.

Please see the [Working Method](https://github.com/PieroWbmstr/Full_PHP_Markdown/wiki/Working-Method) page to learn about this project structure and read the [Working Journal](https://github.com/PieroWbmstr/Full_PHP_Markdown/wiki/Working-Journal) to follow this work, the choices I made and the difficulties I faced.

## Note about this wiki (*and me*)

As I am french (*désolé*), I try to write documentation pages in understandable english ... but I probably make huge language errors. Please be kind enough to correct them or inform me about it ... And, finally, do not held against.

The most important is the meaning, not the writing (*although I'd rather write like Shakespeare*).

Thank you in advance.
