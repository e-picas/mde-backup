Well, here is the point ...

First, just have a look on our reference document at [MD_syntax.md](https://github.com/PieroWbmstr/Full_PHP_Markdown/blob/master/MD_syntax.md) in the repository. This is my base working file that is parsed by the parsers to test results.

I will try here to write my thoughts about this work and the difficulties I faced ... As I am not very at ease with PCRE patterns and replacements, there may be a lot!

## Select the "right" syntaxes

The first difficulty was to choose in older Markdown versions the syntaxes rules and features that seems to me the most relevants and usefulls.

I used to work as a corrector for french texts so I am quite friend with typographic and syntaxic rules that are mostly use, mainly in journalism or administration. Some features that I found very usefull in the Multi Markdown version was the **glossary notes** and **bibliographic references**.
