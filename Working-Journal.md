Well, here is the point ...

First, just have a look on our reference document at [MD_syntax.md](https://github.com/PieroWbmstr/Full_PHP_Markdown/blob/master/MD_syntax.md) in the repository. This is my base wroking file that is parsed by the parsers to test results.

I will try here to write my thoughts about this work and the difficulties I faced ... As I am not very at ease with PCRE patterns and replacements, there may be a lot!
